This project is a proof of concept demonstrating a distributed authentication system inspired by zero-knowledge proofs (in particular: zk- SNARKS), blockchain and distributed computing concepts, as an alternative to current OAuth implementations.
We use Homomorphic Hashing functions to enable a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of authenticity for a client trying to verify themselves.
